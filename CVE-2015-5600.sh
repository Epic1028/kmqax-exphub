# It was found that OpenSSH would allow an attacker to request a large number of keyboard-interactive devices when entering a password, which could allow a remote attacker to bypass the MaxAuthTries limit defined in the sshd_config file.
# This flaw only affects OpenSSH configurations that have the ‘KbdInteractiveAuthentication’ configuration option set to ‘yes’. By default, this option has the same value as the ‘ChallengeResponseAuthentication’ option.
